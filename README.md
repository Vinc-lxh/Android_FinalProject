# Photo Voice Memo

## If only there was an app that captured what people thought as they took a picture. After many years, individuals may listen to the voice memo to refresh their memories. This may result in more vivid and renewing memories, since just glancing at the image is insufficient.

## Our app should be very easy to adopt because of its usage of camera and sensor in the phone. The user can upload the photo voice file to the cloud to save space or login in other device to sync the saved photo voice file.
